# I Have No Idea Yet - Project Ideas

Since we are starting fresh in an empty directory, here are a few concepts based on your recent work history:

## 1. AI Art Studio 🎨
Build a professional interface for your prompt enhancement workflows.
...

## 2. Omani Trivia: Reforged 🇴🇲
...

## 3. The "Everything" Dashboard 📊
...

## 4. Family Game Night (The "Wild" Edition) 🎲👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

A game designed to be played together in a living room, maybe using a TV as the main board and phones as controllers (Jackbox style).

### A. "The Family Truth" (Jackbox Style) 📱
Everyone connects via QR code on their phone.
*   **The Game:** The prompts ask questions about *each other*.
    *   "Who is most likely to eat the last slice of pizza?"
    *   "Write a fake diary entry for Dad."
*   **Voting:** Everyone votes on the best/funniest answer.
*   **Tech:** Socket.io (real-time communication), React, QR Code generation.

### B. AI Pictionary / "Prompt Charades" ✏️
*   **The Game:**
    *   **Mode 1:** You draw, and the AI tries to guess what it is. If it guesses correctly, you get points.
    *   **Mode 2 (Wild):** You write a crazy prompt (e.g., "A shark eating a burger in space"), the AI generates the image, and *everyone else* has to guess what your prompt was.
*   **Tech:** Canvas API (for drawing), Stable Diffusion/DALL-E API (for image generation), Vision API (for AI guessing).

### C. "Soundboard Storytellers" 🎤
*   **The Game:** The game gives you a random sound effect (a splash, a car honk, a scream). You have 30 seconds to improvise a story that *ends* with that sound. The family votes on creativity.
*   **Tech:** Web Audio API, Microphone input (optional for recording).

### D. "Whodunit?" - Digital Murder Mystery �️‍♀️
*   **The Game:** The user inputs the names of everyone playing. The app assigns roles (The Detective, The Victim, The Killer, The Witness) secretly to their phones. The "Main Screen" guides the narrative, telling players when to "perform" an action or reveal a clue.
*   **Tech:** State management for complex game logic, nice spooky UI.

### E. Collaborative Space Team �
*   **The Game:** (Spaceteam style). Everyone has different controls on their phone (switches, buttons, sliders). The instructions for *your* panel appear on *someone else's* screen. You have to yell at each other to keep the spaceship flying.
    *   "Set the Flux Capacitor to 5!" (Only Mom has the Flux Capacitor).
*   **Tech:** Heavy real-time websockets usage. High chaos energy.

Which of these vibes suits the family?
